## User interface

### Create a canvas
For this tutorial, we'll be making a simple UI which will display a score and a timer that counts down as shown above. To get started, create a `Canvas` by clicking `GameObject->UI->Canvas`. A canvas should contain all your UI elements in a scene. Looking at the inspector, you may notice that a canvas is in the UI layer, separate from a 2D/3D scene. Every canvas has the following components:
* Canvas: Allows you to change certain settings of a canvas, such as the `Sort Order` which determines which canvas appears on top.
* Canvas Scaler: Used for controlling the overall scale and pixel density of UI elements in the Canvas. Contains settings that allow UI elements on a canvas to change size depending on screen size and resolution. 
* Graphic Raycaster: Determines if an element on a canvas has been hit (e.g. a button).

## Implementing score
### Score controller
To keep track of score and update the text in the UI, we can create a script that will have a reference to the score text and a public static variable which contain the value of the player's current score. As
```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using TMPro;

public class ScoreController : MonoBehaviour
{
    public static int score = 0;
    public TextMeshProUGUI scoreText;
    
    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        scoreText.text = string.Format("Score: {0}", score); 
    }
}
```
