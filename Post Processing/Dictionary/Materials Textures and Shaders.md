## Materials (and Shaders)
A material is essentially something that contains a lot of behaviors to assign to an object. Examples include how metallic or matte it is, or if it lets off particles. Shaders operate in the same way, but at a much more powerful level. Modifying an object's shader (oftentimes using Unity's built in Shadergraph), can let you simulate things like wind blowing, rippling water, heat waves, and more.

## Textures
Textures can be thought of as candy wrappers or present wrapping; they're flat images that are wrapped around 3D objects to give them detail. One example could be that a cylinder plus a tree bark texture could create a tree stump. Using this method, you can create complex sceneries using simple shapes, and create skyboxes, lighting, and effects with the same.<br>
Note: Textures technically don't "exist" for 2D games-- textures are actually just imported under the name of "Sprites" in a 2D Unity game. This is because 2D does not handle objects/process images the same way.
