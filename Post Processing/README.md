## Setting up a scene:
Start Unity Hub and click on **Projects** on the sidebar. Click on New Project and name the project PostProcessing. Make sure the project type is 3D Core, and the Unity version is 2020.3.19f2 (or some variation of 2020.3 LTS)

Go to Edit > Project Settings > Graphics and make sure that the object under Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings is currently set to None.<br>
[What is a Render Pipeline? -->](Dictionary/Render%20Pipelines.md)

Then go to Window > Package Manager. In the tab that pops up, switch the packages from "In Project" to "Unity Registry". Then search up "High Definition RP" in the search bar. Install it.

 After High Definition Render Pipeline (here on out referred to as HDRP) is finished installing, something called the Render Pipeline Wizard will pop up. Click "Fix All" to fix the errors.
