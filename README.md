# Studio Creative Tutorials - Winter 2023
## Welcome to the Creative Track!
In this series of workshops, you will learn how to create and implement visual, auditory, and design elements in the Unity game engine. If you are interested in making your games look and sound great, this is the series for you! Prior Unity experience is optional, and the tutorials are designed with minimal coding involved. Live workshops will take place **at Boelter 4760 from 6 PM - 8 PM on Tuesdays** or **at Bunche Hall 3178 from 6 PM - 8 PM on Wednesdays**, but if you can't attend in person you can also watch edited recordings on our YouTube channel.

We also offer the [Intro Track](https://github.com/uclaacm/studio-beginner-tutorials) and [Special Topics Track](https://github.com/uclaacm/studio-advanced-tutorials). The Intro Track covers the fundamentals of game development and using the Unity game engine, and is a good starting point for people without prior programming experience. The Special Topics Track focuses on more complex programming concepts and systems, but we encourage you to check it out if you have prior coding experience, even if you haven't used Unity before.
