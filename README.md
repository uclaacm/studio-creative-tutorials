# Studio Creative Tutorials - Fall 2021
## Welcome to the Creative Track!
In this weekly workshop series, you will learn how to create and implement visual, auditory, and narrative elements in the Unity game engine. If you are interested in making your games look and sound great, this is the series for you! Prior Unity experience is optional, as long as you are also attending the [Beginner Track](https://github.com/uclaacm/studio-beginner-tutorials-f21), and the workshops are designed with minimal coding involved. Live workshops will take place **online in the [ACM Studio Discord server](https://discord.gg/bBk2Mcw) from 7 PM - 9 PM on Mondays**, but if you can't attend in person you can also watch edited recordings on our YouTube channel. Unlike the Beginner Track, most of these workshops are independent and do not build upon the previous workshop. But we still encourage you to attend as many as you can to maximize your learning!

We also offer the [Beginner Track](https://github.com/uclaacm/studio-beginner-tutorials-f21) and [Advanced Track](https://github.com/uclaacm/studio-advanced-tutorials-f21). The Beginner Track covers the fundamentals of game development and using the Unity game engine, and is a good starting point for people without prior programming experience. The Advanced Track focuses on more complex programming concepts and systems, but we encourage you to check it out if you have prior coding experience, even if you haven't used Unity before.
