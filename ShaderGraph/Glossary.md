## Glossary
This glossary/word bank is used to help explain certain phrases in the tutorial/README. They will be listed in alphabetical order.
The definitions will also cater to a better understanding of shaders rather than a holistic definition-- please consult elsewhere for a more comprehensive explanation!

### CPU
CPU stands for "Central Processing Unit". The CPU is a microprocessor that does the legwork for your computer's operating system, and is exceptionally good at executing individual complex tasks. Compared to the CPU, it is better at performing individual tasks but not as good at executing in parallel.

### Dithering
Dithering, as a general definition, is a process of adding "noise" to an image to simulate colors that are not included in a color palette. Imagine you only have access to black dots, and white dots. However, you have a canvas that you can apply thousands of dots to. To create the illusion of light grey, you can put only a few dots of black in the middle of white, and then look at it from a distance-- it will create a light grey color without actually using the color itself. Replace the "dots" with pixels on a computer screen, and you have a dithering effect-- mixing different but limited colors in such a way to create an illusion of a new one.
