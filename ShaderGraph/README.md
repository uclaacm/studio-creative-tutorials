## Shaders
### What is a `shader`?
The term `shader` is often used to refer to several related concepts, but in the broadest sense a `shader` is a program that runs on the GPU instead of the CPU. This includes `compute shaders` and `ray tracing shaders`, but for the purposes of this tutorial, we are interested in the type of `shader` which determines the color of pixels. In other words, these `graphics pipeline shaders` determine what you see on the screen.

For the rest of this tutorial, we will use `shader` to refer to this type of `graphics pipeline shader` specifically, unless otherwise noted, but you can read more about these other kinds of `shaders` at the links provided in [Additional Resources](#additional-resources) below.

### What can `shaders` do?
At the very basic level, shaders let your game actually display things - Unity provides a plethora of built-in shaders that do just that. However, shaders can also be used to do much, much more! Here are a few images illustrating what shaders can do:
